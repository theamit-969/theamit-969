## _hello friend

### I'm Amit  

Full-stack builder · Neovim tweaker · Arch + WM daily driver · Not afraid to `:q!`

- I build full-stack apps with clean architecture and purpose-driven features.  
- My workflow runs entirely on Arch + Neovim + Hyprland — fast, minimal, and tuned by hand.  
- I'm into mobile development — building things that people actually use just feels right.  
- Cybersecurity fascinates me — understanding how systems behave beneath the surface is key.  
- I choose tools with intention — nothing extra, nothing random.  

> I like things that do their job and stay out of the way.
